# Summary
    I used class replays and stack overflow to help me complete this task. My push to Heroku was not working. 
    I was receiving the error "No default language could be detected for this app". I could not solve the error for a while.
    After a long Google search, I found the answer on a stack overflow page. I still had the code in the develop folder from the copied starter code.
    So, Heroku could not read the code because it was in a subfolder. Once I moved the code out of the folder, the build was successful!
    It took me a while to find the solution but I'm happy that I did.
    
    Updated the scripts so the app could build, start, and run.
    
    Added the logic for database.js and install.js.
   
    Added in the asset caching.
   
    Updated the webpack.config.js by putting in service workers, css loaders, and babel.
